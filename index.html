                    Forest View is located in Mount Prospect, Illinois, a northwest suburban area of Chicago. 
                We are one of 15 schools in Community Consolidated School District 59. 
                We have approximately 400 students from kindergarten to fifth grade. 
                Forest View first opened its doors in 1962 and has undergone several building renovations over its history. 
                The most recent addition was in 1996, which provided us with the state of the art facility that we have today!
